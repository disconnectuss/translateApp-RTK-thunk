## Translation App
Overview
This is a web-based translation application built with React and Redux Toolkit, utilizing Redux Thunk for asynchronous actions. The app allows users to translate text between various languages, powered by the DeepL API. The user interface is styled with SCSS, ensuring a responsive and modern design. Axios is used for making API requests, providing a robust and scalable way to handle network interactions.
